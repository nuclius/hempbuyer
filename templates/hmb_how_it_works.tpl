                        <p>HBA will transform your hemp business by bringing you quality professionals that want to do
                            business with you. HBA brings buyers and sellers together directly to transact business and
                            get to know one another in a safe environment. Your first sale may be small. A liter of
                            distillate oil or a 100 lb biomass test run for extraction. When that transaction is
                            successful, you’ll likely want to continue to do business together. Perhaps, you’ll
                            eventually decide to do a supply contract. Congratulations!! Success!!</p>

                                    relationship will develop into repeat transactions and or contracts. We’ve designed

                                    value of the transaction. The fees are calculated on all gross income of completed
                                    transactions for the first year of business and on a sliding scale over the next two
                                    years. Think of the HempBuyer Auction/Market as an outside sales force and business

                                    instructions/contract. This discourages fraud and supports equal levels of
                                    protection throughout your entire transaction process. We’ve negotiated negligible
                                    fees for escrow services. The minimal fees are well worth the additional safety an
                                    escrow offers. Seller’s simply calculate the HBA transaction service and escrow fees
                                    in establishing your listing prices. Escrow fees can be paid by the seller, buyer or
                                    split 50/50. It’s very affordable. All parties involved are protected. </p>

                                    <p>Generally the seller calculates and adds these fees into their sales price. However,
                                    the buyer and seller can negotiate on who is responsible for the escrow fees. Once
                                    escrow is opened, cancellation of an escrow may incur a fee. Please review your
                                    escrow instructions and agreement to terms. Generally, escrow cancellation fee is
                                    estimated at ½% of the escrow balance. Example, $1000.00 is deposited in escrow.
                                    Buyer cancels escrow. Escrow cancellation fee is $50. Who pays for escrow
                                    cancellation fee? Buyer and seller negotiate this term as part of their agreement.
                                    Generally, it is the buyer. Please refer to your escrow agreement and your
                                    negotiated contract. Your escrow officer will gladly provide you with personal
                                    assistance.</p>

                                        <u>Auction/Minimum-Bid Auction:</u> The seller pre-determines the lowest
                                        acceptable price (reserve price). The seller may post a lower starting price to
                                        get the auction ball rolling. However, if the reserve price is not met, the
                                        product does not sell.
                                        A seller may also offer a <u>Buy Now</u> price option with a minimum order
                                        quantity of product. If a portion of the auction product listing is sold with
                                        the <u>Buy Now</u> option, the listing will automatically become a <u>Fixed
                                            Price</u> listing. The seller may then go into their dashboard and relist
                                        his product as a new auction with the new inventory level or keep it as a
                                        <u>Fixed Price</u> listing.

                                        <u>Fixed Price:</u> A <u>Fixed Price</u> listing is used when the seller knows
                                        his acceptable fixed sale price on his product/s.

                                        <u>Make An Offer:</u> A seller may post a product with a suggested offer price.
                                        He may entertain all offers that come in but is only obligated to sell at the
