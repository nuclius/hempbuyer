                <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
                <p>HempBuyer Auction is breaking the cycle of chasing dead end sales leads through creating an efficient marketplace for industrial hemp buyers and sellers.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Our selling members were previously trapped in the cycle of sending out pictures, videos and test results to strangers with little results. Now, they are empowered to connect with other buying members who are serious about hemp business development and connections. This is the basis for a structured brighter future.</p>

                    <h1>Why we are here</h1>
                    <p>We started our hemp industry careers by helping growers sell their products in 2006. We experienced and heard the stories of corrupted, unsafe and failed transactions. Like you, we spent countless hours chasing leads that went nowhere. We wanted something different for our customers and ourselves. So we created Hempbuyer Auction, a structured marketplace and business development service.</p>
