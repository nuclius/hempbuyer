                    <h6>3. How are the members vetted?</h6>

                    <p>Membership is free</p>
                    <h6>5. Is there a cost for the vetting process?</h6>
                    <p>There is no cost for members to go through the vetting process. HBA absorbs all costs of the vetting process. Our goal is to create a marketplace culture of honesty, integrity and professionalism. A safe structured business development service with low cost/risk and high ROI.
                    </p>
                    <h6>6. Are there transaction service fees? How does HBA make money? </h6>
                    <p>Yes. HBA is a business development site and auction/market. Our goal is to introduce as many buyers and sellers as possible. People do business with people they know, like and trust. Once buyer and seller members are introduced, we hope this business relationship will develop into repeat transactions and or contracts. We’ve designed the platform specifically to help you grow your business with low risk, no upfront cost. Our goal is to help you develop your business and in turn assist the industrial hemp market development and stability.
                    </p>
                    <p>The seller’s <u>transaction service fee commitment</u> is between 4.5 - 10% depending on the value of the transaction. The fees are calculated on all gross income of completed transactions for the first year of business and on a sliding scale over the next two years. Think of the HempBuyer Auction/Market as an outside sales force and business development service. <a> Click Here to view the fee schedule.</a> </p>
                    <p>If your buyer becomes a repeat buyer, and WE HOPE THEY DO!... your sellers transaction service fee commitment continues on a sliding scale for a total of three years once the buyer and seller are introduced. You win, they win, we all win.</p>
                    <h6>7. Why is escrow or attorney services required on transactions &gt;$15,001.00? </h6>
                    <p>Hemp is no longer a back of the truck or parking lot transaction business. It’s quickly on its way to becoming an internationally traded commodity. It’s simply safer to use escrow or transaction attorneys for successful transactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Using an escrow decreases risk to both buyer and seller. A trusted third party collects, holds and disburses funds according to buyer and seller agreed upon instructions/contract. This discourages fraud and supports equal levels of protection throughout your entire transaction process. We’ve negotiated negligible fees for escrow services. The minimal fees are well worth the additional safety an escrow offers. Seller’s simply calculate the HBA transaction service and escrow fees in establishing your listing prices. Escrow fees can be paid by the seller, buyer or split 50/50. It’s very affordable. All parties involved are protected.
                    </p>
                    <h6>8. How much does escrow or transaction attorneys cost? </h6>
                    <p>These fees vary. Generally between 1-3% of the transaction value.
                    </p>
                    <h6>9. Who pays for the escrow fees? </h6>
                    <p>Generally the seller calculates and adds these fees into their sales price. However, the buyer and seller can negotiate on who is responsible for the escrow fees. Once escrow is opened, cancellation of an escrow may incur a fee. Please review your escrow instructions and agreement to terms. Generally, escrow cancellation fee is estimated at ½% of the escrow balance. Example, $1000.00 is deposited in escrow. Buyer cancels escrow. Escrow cancellation fee is $50. Who pays for escrow cancellation fee? Buyer and seller negotiate this term as part of their agreement. Generally, it is the buyer. Please refer to your escrow agreement and your negotiated contract. Your escrow officer will gladly provide you with personal assistance.</p>
                    <h6>10. Are there any additional fees? </h6>
                    <p>There may be nominal fees for wire transfer, credit card or ACH processing. Your transaction coordinator will fully inform you of the details of your transaction. These transaction fees are generally incurred by the buyer. </p>
                    <h6>11. Can I use my own escrow/attorney? </h6>
                    <p>Yes</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Auction/Minimum-Bid Auction: The seller pre-determines the lowest acceptable price (reserve price). The seller may post a lower starting price to get the auction ball rolling. However, if the reserve price is not met, the product does not sell.</li>

                            <li>A seller may also offer a Buy Now price option with a minimum order quantity of product. If a portion of the auction product listing is sold with the Buy Now option, the listing will automatically become a Fixed Price listing. The seller may then go into their dashboard and relist his product as a new auction with the new inventory level or keep it as a Fixed Price listing.
                            </li>
