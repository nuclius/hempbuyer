            <p>HBA requires escrow services be used for the safety of both seller and buyer. Escrow services
                are generally 1% of the sale. It’s very affordable service and well worth the safety it
                provides. <a type="button" data-target="#escrowModal" data-toggle="modal">Click Here</a> to
                learn more about how Escrow works. Sellers must keep in mind 1%
                escrow services fee and HBA service fees when establishing their product prices. Escrow
                services fee may be paid by seller, buyer or split between seller and buyer. Terms are
                negotiable as part of the sale contract.</p>
