                        <p>This Terms and Conditions Agreement (hereinafter, this “Agreement”) outlines the basis and manner in which HempBuyer is willing to provide Users (as hereinafter defined) with access to, and use of Services (as defined hereinafter).  As used in this Agreement, the term “Services” shall mean, collectively, the following: (1) providing an online platform for Users to buy and sell industrial hemp, (2) assisting Users with making and receiving payment for transactions conducted through HempBuyer’s Website (www.hempbuyer.com) (hereinafter, the “Website”), and (3) the other services described in this Agreement. </p>
                        <p>HempBuyer may make changes to any part of this Agreement at any time with notice to the Users. When such a change is proposed, HempBuyer will notify all Users of that change, as well as the date that the change will take effect.</p>
                        <p>Each Account (as defined hereinafter) and User is responsible for ensuring that it (and all of its Accounts and Users) have read, understood, and acknowledge this Agreement and future revisions. </p>
                        <p>By continuing to access and use the Services, each User represents that it accepts, and agrees to be bound by, the latest version of the Agreement. If, following any such change or amendment, any User who no longer agrees to be bound by this Agreement (as amended) must  notify HempBuyer  in writing and, upon HempBuyer’s receipt of such written notice, agree to discontinue its use of the Services.  Any such notice must be provided to @ admin@hempbuyer.com.</p>

                        <h6>1.1 How to register as a User</h6>
                        <p>Unless otherwise approved by HempBuyer, the Services may be accessed and used only by Users. A person may apply to register as a User by submitting an application in the manner prescribed by HempBuyer from time to time on the public section of the Website.</p>
                        <h6>1.2 Registration warranties</h6>
                        <p>By submitting an application, each applicant warrants and represents that: (a) it has all necessary power, authority and capacity to enter into and carry out its obligations under this Agreement; (b) the entry into, and performance of, this Agreement, will not result in violation of any laws, restrictions or requirements to which the applicant is subject; and (c) it makes the application, and enters into this Agreement, as a principal or as an agent with principal acknowledgement which shall be provided in writing to HempBuyer.</p>
                        <h6>1.3 Accuracy of application</h6>
                        <p>An applicant must provide the standard information requested by HempBuyer on the Website, as well as any additional information requested by HempBuyer that is relevant to its assessment of the application. Each applicant warrants and represents that the information it provides in its application is complete and accurate. Each User whose application is accepted is responsible for updating any of the information provided by it in its application if that information changes while it is a User.</p>
                        <h6>1.4 Acceptance does not confer approval to buy</h6>
                        <p>Acceptance as a User does not confer on that User the approval to buy products that are listed on the Wesbite or obtainable through the Services. Approval to buy products will arise only if a Seller (as hereinafter defined) has enabled that User to buy its products in accordance with paragraph 5.3.</p>
                        <h6>1.5 Discretion to decline to register</h6>
                        <p>HempBuyer reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to decline to register any person as a User without the requirement to provide any reasons. Without limiting that discretion, HempBuyer will not consider an application by a person to be registered as a User unless that person has a genuine intention to use the Services as intended and as offered.</p>
                        <h6>1.6 Authorized Users</h6>
                        <p>One or more individuals may be authorized by a user to use its Account (each a "User"). Each User must have his or her own login credentials and will be required to acknowledge that they have read and understood the terms and conditions of this Agreement before proceeding to access and use the Services.</p>
                        <p>Each User warrants and represents that all of its Users are duly authorized to act on its behalf and to represent it in all matters relating to this Agreement and the Services. In no event will HempBuyer be required to inquire as to the authority of any User to bind the relevant User.</p>

                        <p>Upon an applicant’s successful application to become a User, HempBuyer will create an Account for each such User under which all transactions using the Services will occur.  Users will be responsible for notifying HempBuyer which individual Users are authorized to use the Account.  Each Account and each of its individual Users associated therewith will be bound by, and liable for, all acts and omissions of such Account.</p>
                        <h6>1.8 Login information</h6>
                        <p>Each User is responsible for keeping, and ensuring that each of its Users keep, its login information, including its Username and password, secret and secure. Without limiting the foregoing, no User will: (a) permit any unauthorized person to use its User name or otherwise gain access to its Account; or (b) disclose, or provide to any unauthorized person password, email address, User name or any other information in connection with its registration that may allow them to gain access to its Account (or any Accounts).</p>
                        <p>If any User fails to comply with the foregoing, then that User agrees that it will be bound by, and liable for, any actions taken by any unauthorized person accessing the Services using that User's Account.</p>

                        <p>The Services and Website are designed to provide a venue for users to buy and sell hemp products. HempBuyer does not itself take part in the sale of any such products, other than by providing access to the  Services to Users via the Website. When a product is sold on through the Services, a binding contract of sale is formed between the seller of the product (a “Seller”) and the successful buyer(s) (“Buyer(s)” on the terms disclosed to the Buyer(s) under paragraph  5.4 (each a "Contract").  Generally, Buyers pay for transportation/shipping and insurance.  Escrow fees are generally to be negotiated between the parties.</p>
                        <h6>2.2 HempBuyer not a party to Contracts</h6>
                        <p>HempBuyer is not a party to, and is not liable or responsible for, any Contract that is entered into between users, nor does HempBuyer act as an agent for any such party to a Contract. Disputes between Users under a Contract are governed by the terms of that Contract. It is not the responsibility of HempBuyer to resolve, or be involved in, any such disputes.</p>
                        <h6>2.3 Participation at User's risk</h6>
                        <p>The access to and use of the Website and the Services is undertaken entirely at each User's own risk. HempBuyer is not liable or responsible for any misconduct or misrepresentation on the part of any User whatsoever, and gives no undertakings, representations or warranties in relation to products listed and/or sold on the Website or through the Services, including the availability, merchantability or delivery of any such products.</p>

                        <p>A Seller must approve which Buyers may participate in that Seller's listings, but has no obligation to approve any Buyer. Buyers may contact a Seller requesting that they be approved for a listing. A Seller may only approve a Buyer's eligibility for the purpose of potentially selling products to that Buyer and not for any other reason, including for the purpose of allowing that Buyer to monitor information disclosed through a Seller's listings without any intention to participate in that Seller's listings. HempBuyer does not have authority to approve a Buyer on behalf of a Seller without that Seller's consent or to require a Seller to approve a Buyer.</p>
                        <h6>5.4 Terms and conditions of sales of products</h6>
                        <p>A Seller must provide to each approved Buyer a copy of the terms and conditions on which that Seller is prepared to sell the listed product to that Buyer (if it is successful) that is to apply to that sale and which will be incorporated into the Contract.  HempBuyer shall at it’s discretion from time to time make available terms and conditions templates for review and use by Sellers, but HempBuyer in no way warrants the usability or legality of such templates. A Seller may make changes to such terms and conditions, but not as to quantity, quality, price, and location of the product(s).</p>
                        <p>A Seller may: (a) apply different terms (other than in respect of the price, quantity, quality, and location of product(s)) to different Buyers, including by requiring additional charges to be paid by a particular Buyer in addition to the price(s) at which the listing is won (for example, in relation to additional freight, or insurance) in which case such terms will be provided to each such Buyer at the time at which the Seller approves that Buyer's participation in its listings (as amended by the Seller from time to time); or (b) upload in its listing (at the time at which the listing is first published) the terms that will apply to all approved Buyers (or any approved Buyers in respect of which no specific terms have been provided in accordance with subclause (a) above).</p>
                        <h6>5.5 Visibility of prices</h6>
                        <p>If a Seller elects to list a product on the Website with: (a) a fixed price or a starting price, that price will be disclosed  to all registered Buyers ; or (b) a reserve price, that reserved price will remain confidential to the Seller at all times.</p>
                        <h6>5.6 No avoidance</h6>
                        <p>Once a listing has been made by a Seller, and for the duration of that listing, the Seller must not sell the particular products contained in that listing or otherwise seek to avoid the fees payable to HempBuyer. Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to HempBuyer, any attempts by a Seller to avoid the fees payable to HempBuyer, including through premature withdrawal of a listing may result in HempBuyer suspending or terminating that Seller's access to the Website and/or Services.</p>
                        <h6>5.7 Sellers must act in good faith</h6>
                        <p>Each Seller acknowledges that, in listing a particular parcel of products on the Website, it does so with the intention of selling those products via the Website and Services. Although HempBuyer does not require a Seller to sell the products contained in a particular listing, Sellers are required to act in good faith and only list products a Seller intends to sell as of the time the Seller posts a particular listing.  Sellers are free to  sell the particular parcel of products that is the subject of a listing through another forum for the duration of the listing and may advertise its products generally via alternative forums, including in respect of the types of products the subject of a listing). In the event that a product listed by a Seller is no longer available for sale, then the Seller must update the listing for such products.  If a Seller has received an offer to purchase products contained in a particular listing from an approved Buyer, has not accepted that Buyer’s offer, and no longer desires to sell the particular products, then the Seller must contact the Buyer(s) who has submitted the un-accepted offer and notify the Buyer that the products are no longer available.</p>
                        <h6>5.8 Modification of listing</h6>
                        <p>Each Seller acknowledges that the Website may limit or restrict the ability to modify a listing after it is published. Once a listing has been published, a Seller may only amend that listing (or any part of it) to the extent permitted by this Agreement.</p>
                        <h6>5.9 Withdrawal of listing </h6>
                        <p>A Seller may withdraw a listing under the following circumstances:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                            <li>PRIOR to a bid or purchase having been received by a Buyer in relation to that listing;</li>
                            <li>AFTER a bid or purchase has been received in relation to that listing, provided a bona fide reason for doing so and the Seller has obtained HempBuyer's prior written consent;</li>
                            <li>In the case of the withdrawal of a listing to be undertaken by way of a tender or auction, it has committed to resolve any issues with the Buyer(s) that have submitted a bid in respect of the listing which is approved by both the Buyer and Hempbuyer in writing;</li>
                            <li>In the case of the withdrawal of a partially sold fixed price listing, such withdrawal does not invalidate a purchase that has been submitted prior to the withdrawal of the listing; and</li>
                            <li>If the approved Buyers for that listing have been unable to bid on or purchase products in relation to that listing due to the Website being precluded from operations for a significant or relevant period of time. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If a listing is withdrawn, all fees due to Hemp Buyer, if any, shall remain the responsibility of the Seller.</p>
                        <p>Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to HempBuyer, HempBuyer may, halt or terminate ANY listing that does not, in HempBuyer's sole opinion, comply with this Agreement.</p>
                        <h6>5.10 Seller to contact Buyers</h6>
                        <p>Following the successful completion of a listing, a Seller must contact each successful Buyer for its product in a timely manner and take such action as is required to give effect to the sale on the terms set out in the relevant Contract. If the successful Buyer is an Affiliate of the Seller, the Seller must promptly notify HempBuyer of that fact.</p>
                        <h6>5.11 Failure to complete transaction</h6>
                        <p>If a Seller completes a listing and fails to deliver the products bought by the successful Buyer or otherwise fails to comply with the Contract (as determined by HempBuyer based on the information available to it), then, without prejudice to paragraph 2.2 and without limiting any rights the Buyer may have under the Contract or at law, HempBuyer may, in its sole discretion, issue the Seller with a warning, or may suspend or terminate that Seller's access to the Website and/or Services.</p>

                        <h6>6.1 Bids and purchases</h6>
                        <p>A Buyer that has been approved by a Seller to participate in a listing is under no obligation to submit a bid or otherwise purchase products that are the subject of the listing. Once a Buyer submits a bid or purchase on a listing, a Buyer may retract its bid at any time prior to the time that a bid is accepted by a Seller.  Once a Buyer’s bid is accepted by a Seller, a Buyer may only cancel the transaction if either California law or the law applicable to the transaction between the Buyer and Seller permits the cancellation, such as for fraud, mistake, duress, undue influence, or similar grounds. A Buyer may also retract a bid in circumstances where a listing is undertaken by way of a tender (in which case a bid is retractable by a Buyer up until the time at which the tender closes). </p>
                        <h6>6.2 Representation</h6>
                        <p>A Buyer must only submit a bid or purchase if it intends to buy the relevant product at the price and quantity entered (in respect of a listing to be undertaken by way of a tender or auction) or listed (in respect of a fixed price listing). By submitting a bid or purchase (as applicable), a Buyer warrants and represents to the Seller that it has the legal right to enter into and complete the transaction on the terms of the Contract.</p>
                        <h6>6.3 Demand visibility</h6>
                        <p>In certain circumstances, HempBuyer may (but is not obliged to) make available to a Seller information concerning the quantity or price of the unsuccessful bids submitted in respect of that Seller's listing, provided that such information does not identify, or enable a recipient of the information to identify, the identity of any unsuccessful Buyers or their bidding conduct. The Seller will be informed of the identity of the successful Buyer or Buyers, together with the winning price and quantity established for each Contract between such parties.</p>
                        <h6>6.4 Successful Buyers</h6>

                            <li>Once a Buyer has been notified that it has been successful on a listing, it must complete the transaction on the terms of the Contract unless it is subject to cancellation under applicable law.</li>
                            <li>Except to the relevant Seller, the identity of each successful Buyer will remain confidential. In relation to specific listings, in no event will HempBuyer publish or otherwise disclose that Buyer's identity to any party other than the relevant Seller.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>6.5 Failure to complete transaction </h6>
                        <p>If a Buyer is successful on a listing and that Buyer fails to pay the Seller for the products in respect of that listing or otherwise fails to comply with the Contract (as determined by HempBuyer based on the information available to it), then without limiting any rights the Seller may have under the Contract or at law, HempBuyer may, in its sole discretion, issue the Buyer with a warning, or may suspend or terminate that Buyer's access to and use of the Website and/or Services.</p>
