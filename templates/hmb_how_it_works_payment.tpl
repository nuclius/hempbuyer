                    <h1>Escrow - How it works </h1>
                    <p>Escrow is a financial instrument held by an independent third party on behalf of the two other parties who are completing a transaction. It’s like a trust account held by a third party while all the seller and buyer’s obligations are fulfilled. All the details of the contract are completed and fulfilled, then funds are released to the seller.
